### üë§ Whoami
I am a passionate and dedicated professional with a strong background in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science & Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (IT), and I am set to graduate in Spring 2025.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Software Engineering
- üçÉ **[Stoopify (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.stoopify)**, **[Stoopify (Web)](https://web.stoopify.it/)** | Dart, Flutter
<br />**Transforming urban stooping into a connected community.**
<br />Stoopify is an innovative application enabling people to share, find, and give away items using the art of stooping. With social network features like messaging, user profiles, and geolocation-based searches, it bridges the gap between sustainability and community-building.
- ‚ôüÔ∏è **[Gambetto](https://github.com/martinopiaggi/Gambetto)** | Unity, C#
<br />An open-source casual arcade game with puzzle elements, Gambetto was crafted by a team of five MSc Engineering students as part of a university project. Players navigate dungeon-like levels, facing enemy chess pieces and using power-ups to gain new abilities. With about 20 minutes of gameplay, it serves as a proof of concept, and the team is committed to its expansion. Downloadable executables are available on its [itch.io page](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/gambetto), along with a game design document offering architectural insights. Contributions are welcome, with detailed guidelines for level design and feature proposals.

- üé≤ **[Eriantys](https://github.com/lorenzo-morelli/Eriantys)** | Java, JavaFX
<br />This project brings the board game [Eriantys](https://www.craniocreations.it/en/product/eriantys) into the digital world, using a client/server architecture with both CLI and GUI interfaces. It supports multiplayer matches, ensures resilience to disconnections, and includes beginner and expert game modes, offering an engaging and reliable gaming experience.

### üß† Machine Learning & AI
- ü§ñ **[Artificial Neural Networks Challenges](https://github.com/lorenzo-morelli/ANN-Challenges)** | Python, Tensorflow
 <br />These challenges explored deep learning applications in image classification and time series forecasting. The first involved identifying plant health using ConvNeXt, achieving over 91% accuracy. The second focused on predicting future sequences with LSTM models, showcasing the versatility of neural networks.
- üí¨ **[Question-Answering Bot](https://github.com/lorenzo-morelli/Question-Answering-Bot)** | Python, PyTorch
<br />An exploration of Transformer-based models like BERT and RoBERTa for answering questions using the SQuAD2.0 dataset. This project integrates Wikipedia API for real-world applications and includes interactive features for testing custom queries.
